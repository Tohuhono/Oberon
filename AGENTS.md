## Essentials

This is the OberonCMS monorepo for the CMS core, plugins, and Next.js apps.

- Use pnpm workspaces with turborepo.
- Non-standard check: `pnpm check` runs lint + typecheck.

## Follow-up docs

- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` (agent workflow + validation)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (adapter/plugin system + data flow)
- `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` (Next.js + Oberon wiring patterns)
